##### Numpy challenge

3 numpy arrays created 3 different ways.

Defined 6 functions: 

`matrix_multiplication` multiplies 2 given matrices.

`multiplication_check` checks if matrices from given list of matrices can be multiplied. Returns `True` if they can and `False` if they can not.

`multiply_matrices` returns multiplied matrix from list of matrices if they can be multiplied and `None` if they can not.

`compute_2d_distance` returns distance between two 2D coordinates.

`compute_multidimensional_distance` returns distance between two multidimensional coordinates.

`compute_pair_distances` returns matrix of distances between number of multidimensional coordinates, given as matrix, where every row is coordinate.
