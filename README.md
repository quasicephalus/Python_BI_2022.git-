### Pandas and visualization

##### 1. "Working with real data" 
Defined functions `read_gff` anf `read_bed` for reading .gff and .bed files and returning pandas data frame.

From .gff number of RNA of each type for each chromosome was obtained and then plotted.

Data frame with intersected aligned reads was obtained in BEDtools-like manner

##### 2. Plot customization 

Original plot is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OEGfkgBlitrm46x_4F-51RqRNzveAanW/view). It was reproduced with maximum accuracy with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

Additional plot to copy is [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/d/1HsyDtbt0c-W2diWdvAe87b1G0vMsSt_ucI5jLyVtwYU/edit?usp=drive_web). It was partially reproduced at the cost of mental health.
